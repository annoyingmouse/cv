## Currently

After the publication of my book on Front-end Development I have been focusing on work as well as writing a follow on exploring the evolution of a web application from ES5 to ES6. I spend most of my time fascinated by, learning and implementing the newest trends in web development (while keeping a weather eye on IE11). I primarily work with HTML, CSS and the JavaScript (JS) language - though I am happy to use whatever will get the job done. Originally a psychiatric nurse in the NHS for the best part of two decades I've been working in IT for well over a decade now.

I have spoken to [Robert Faldo](https://career-switching-coders.simplecast.com/episodes/dominic-myers-episode-6) about my experience in changing my career. I also talked with [Ben Donkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsfMKbzeLvg) about remote working - I worked from home before it became necessary.

I share the things I have learnt online on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/592058/annoyingmouse) and [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@annoyingmouse). I also maintain and contribute to some Repos on [Github](https://github.com/annoyingmouse) and I'm honoured to be an Arctic Code Vault Contributor.
