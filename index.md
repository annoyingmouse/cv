## Currently

After the publication of my book on [Front-end Development](https://shop.bcs.org/store/221/detail/workgroup?id=3-221-9781780174761) by the BCS I have been focusing on work. I am writing a follow on book exploring the evolution of a web application from ES5 to ES6; The original application used as an example in my book.

I spend most of my time fascinated by, learning and implementing the newest trends in web development (while keeping a weather eye on IE11). While I primarily work with HTML, CSS and the JavaScript (JS) language - I am happy to use whatever will get the job done. Originally an NHS psychiatric nurse, for the best part of two decades, I've been working in IT for well over a decade now.

I have spoken to [Robert Faldo](https://career-switching-coders.simplecast.com/episodes/dominic-myers-episode-6) about my experience in changing my career and I also talked with [Ben Donkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsfMKbzeLvg) about remote working - I worked from home before it became quite so necessary.

I share the things I have learnt online on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/592058/annoyingmouse) and [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@annoyingmouse). I also maintain and contribute to some Repos on [Github](https://github.com/annoyingmouse) and I'm honoured to be an Arctic Code Vault Contributor.

### Specialises in

HTML, CSS, JS with a particular emphasis on Vue, but an abiding appreciation of Vanilla JS. I have used TypeScript and React as well as Angular, but not to the extent that I've used Vue. Please do check my GitHub profile to check my coding. I have also worked with Node and PHP.

## Occupation

__Volunteer, [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk)__, Soham, UK
		
Keen on helping the next generation embrace technology, I volunteered to be a Code Club Volunteer at a Primary School.

* Created a mobile-based prototype for the Matilda System using Semantic UI and Twig. Implementing it as a mobile application using Firebase and AngularJS.
