## Currently

After the publication of my book on [Front-end Development](https://shop.bcs.org/store/221/detail/workgroup?id=3-221-9781780174761) by the BCS, I am working on a linked work.

I spend most of my time fascinated by, learning and implementing the newest trends in web development (while keeping a weather eye on IE11). While I primarily work with HTML, CSS and the JS language - I am happy to use whatever will get the job done. My first career was as a psychiatric nurse in the NHS; I’ve worked in development for well over a decade now.

I have been interviewed by [Robert Faldo](https://career-switching-coders.simplecast.com/episodes/dominic-myers-episode-6) and [Ben Donkin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsfMKbzeLvg) about changing careers and remote working, respectively.

I share the things I have learnt and try to help other online on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/592058/annoyingmouse) and [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@annoyingmouse).

### Specialises in

HTML, CSS and JS - with an emphasis on Vue, but an abiding appreciation of Vanilla JS. I have used TypeScript and React as well as Angular, but not to the same extent. Please do check my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/annoyingmouse). On the backend, I have also worked with Node and PHP.

## Occupation

`2017 - PRESENT`
__Volunteer, [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk)__, Soham, UK
		
Keen on helping the next generation embrace technology; I volunteer as a Code Club Volunteer at a Primary School. I have developed resources to teach modern JS techniques to children and young people. I was appointed as a [Code Club Champion](https://blog.codeclub.org/2018/02/01/meet-the-2018-code-club-champions/) in the first batch of such ambassadors.

`2017 - PRESENT`
__Web Developer - JavaScript & CSS Wizard__ [Vigilant Software](https://www.vigilantsoftware.co.uk/)

Forgive the odd job title; it was not my choice and did not come with a pointy hat. I have been working here to help develop online regulatory software that saves time and money using the Vue JS library atop a .Net platform. 

`2014 - 2017` 
__Senior UI Developer__ [Arcus Global Ltd](https://www.arcusglobal.com/)

* I created a cross-platform mobile app to allow Building Inspectors to work remotely.
* Developed a mobile-based prototype for the Matilda System using Semantic UI and Twig templating. Implementing it as a mobile application using Firebase and AngularJS.
* Created a prototype portal to interface between clients and AWS; this focus on serverless architecture is something I’m keen to explore further.

`2010 - 2014` 
__Cloud Developer__ [Arcus Global Ltd](https://www.arcusglobal.com/)

* I served as the designer and developer of DataTAP, an [award-winning](https://www.theguardian.com/megas/winners-2011) platform for the publication of open data for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.
* Lead the development of Shimme, an innovative platform for communicating about psychiatric medication management for ARU and CPFT.
* Developed and designed critical parts of the LGInform prototype, the Local Government Associations innovative platform for Council performance management and benchmarking.
* I designed and implemented the front-end of the Indigo Children’s Centre Software.
* Created Node.js applications to enable members of the public or professionals to report concerns to a London Borough, using Salesforce as a backend.

`2014` __Developer__ [Hope UK](http://www.hopeuk.org/)

I replaced this charity’s archaic database with a web application and continue to help them intermittently when it comes to supporting business changes.

`2005` __Website Design and Implementation__ Various

I carried out website design and development as well as social media advice for various clients and friends.

`1997 - 2010` __RMN__ CPFT

* Worked as an RMN on nights.
* I introduced the formal recording of sleep patterns for all patients.
